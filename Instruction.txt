1) Install dll library | Alternatively run the prepared script with admin to perform the copy automatically
  COPY: glut32.dll
  TO: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\
  Alternative: Execute "Run As Admin to Copy.bat" to copy

2) Install MinGW32 compiler | Alternatively run the prepared script with admin to perform the copy automatically
  COPY: MinGW32
  TO: C:\
  Alternative: Execute "Run As Admin to Copy.bat" to copy 

3) Add MinGW32 To User Environment Variables | Alternatively run the prepared script with admin to perform the copy automatically
  Value: C:\MinGW32\bin
  To: User Variables
  Step:
    1) In Start menu, search "Edit the System Environment Variables" and run the program as shown in figure 1.png.
    2) Follow the steps as shown figure 2.png, 3.png, and 4.png to complete adding the path variable.
  Why: To tell the system to look in the directory for imported library like "#include <windows.h>".

  Alternative: Execute "Run As Admin to Add Path Variable.bat" to add the value to the user variables.

4) Install C++ Extension Pack in VS Code
  Note: There are 2 approaches available, both leads to same outcome anyway.
  Approach 1 - Step:
    1) Open the link "Approach 1 - Link"
    2) Click the green install button and follow through to install the extension pack in VS Code.

  Approach 2 - Step:
    1) Open VS codes
    2) Go to Extensions tab as shown in "Approach 2 - Step"
    3) Search for "C++ Extension Pack"
    4) Install the extension pack. *make sure it is from Microsoft"

5) New Project:
  COPY Folder: .vscode
  TO: <your_project_folder>
  Note: The folder structure should look like this folder for every project. It consisting the codes in C/C++ and most importantly the ".vscode" configuration folder.
  Why: The ".vscode" configuration folder consist "tasks.json" file that consist of custom settings that includes settings for compiler (pointing to "g++.exe" that is found in the folder copied in step 2), and specific arguments.

6) Compile and Run:
  Open "5) New Project" folder in VS Code > Open "main.cpp" > Press "F5" key to compile and run. > Select "C++ (GDB/LLDB)" when prompted.
  Once the compiler is done compiling, a small window of rendered graphic will be shown *refer to figure "2 Expected outcome.png"*
